    <p>We help you find likeminded people when traveling so you can - not only learn about yourself and a destination - but also learn a new skill, meet people and have fun.</p>
    <p>Learn with Locals started from the idea that traveling isn't just about going places, it is essentially about people and broadening your horizon. We call it learning, not only learning new skills, but also learning about yourself and about others.</p>

    <p> You can choose to sign up as a local friend and teacher or as lifelong learner and student - or perhaps both?</p>
    <p>As a local friend, even if you are not currently traveling, you might still be looking for connection and what better way to do that, than by teaching someone something only YOU know best?</p>
