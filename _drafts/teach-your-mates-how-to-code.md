‚ÄúHalf a year ago I was drowning in work. I had a lot on my mind, and I didn‚Äôt have any time to move forward with my personal projects - and I can tell you one thing; I‚Äôm always full of new ideas, but completing them takes a lot of time.‚Äù

Meet Johnny Fekete - a digital nomad who originally comes from a business background, but taught himself how to code and is now a self-taught full-stack developer and entrepreneur. He is also the co-founder of Danish startup [Ditaso](https://ditaso.net/en/index.php), ( a digital talent sourcing and recruitment tool.)

Besides developing things and teaching others, he loves long boarding and learning how to play the guitar.&nbsp; Learn how Johnny taught his mates how to code and how they went from zero to hero in just less than half a year.

Where did the idea of teaching your mates come from

‚ÄúHalf a year ago I talked a lot with Szabi‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa friend of mine‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat he would be interested in learning mobile programming; at the same time, my brother also decided that he needs a career change, and he could imagine himself as a front-end developer.‚Äù

‚ÄúHigher education takes a lot of time, and they often teach outdated knowledge when it comes to fast-moving technologies. Besides that, my mates were both so busy with their lives, so no time for universities nor going back to school, they needed something faster and more efficient.‚Äù

Can you tell me how it all started?

I don‚Äôt think there was an exact moment when I made a decision to start teaching my friends.

I was in a situation where I had a lot of ideas that I couldn't bring to life because of the lack of time and I had some friends, including my brother, who were interested in learning something new - especially my brother who was really thinking in a career change.

The idea was that if I would spend some time on teaching them, they could help me with my own projects. It would be a great practice for them too, as they need experience, and my projects would finally move forward.

We talked about it many times, we figured out which areas interested them, and we found that we had similar interests in exchanging our skills.

üòÉ A real win-win situation.

Can you tell me a little about how did you taught them, did your create your own learning material or did you mostly use online materials?

First of all I created a list for both of them about the subject/tools/techniques that I thought were relevant. Like a TO-DO list: if you learn this and this and that, you'll know enough to start developing yourself - in my opinion.

Then I tried to look up as many materials online, as I could.&nbsp; Luckily, coding are based on popular technologies that are really well covered, so very easy to find information and learning material to put together my own foundation.

How did you go about teaching?

Once we had the learning direction, my mates could move in their own pace, ask me questions when they got stuck, and I also asked questions to make sure that they understood everything.

I live in another country, so we had Skype sessions with screen share, where I could see what they were doing. Also, the very first thing I taught them was how to use Git, so from the first time I could review their codes.

What were some of the challenges you encountered during the process?

The initial list of what to teach and where to start was tricky to write. For example, I tried to google: ‚ÄúWhat does a front-end developer have to know", but I didn't really find anything in details.

Maybe sometimes it would have been easier to explain things in person, but thanks to screen sharing and Skype calls, there was not that much of a difference.

What were some of the rewarding aspects of teaching your mates?

Actually, I found it very rewarding in many ways:

I could help two great people to get better with technologies that I know.

I could also learn about new stuff on the go and give a nice overview/structure for my own knowledge.

My own projects moved forward as we used them as example tasks, so teaching them, actually freed up time for me to work on my&nbsp; own projects that had been sitting there collecting dust for so long.

I could spend a lot more time with them (virtually), so our relationships improved a lot.

Can you point out one thing in particular that you learned in the process of teaching your friends?

Yes, I became quite a pro in react native, a technology I always wanted to master, and I learned how to explain and provide a structure for my existing knowledge.

So why teach coding for a friend?

* You can work on your own projects, the ones that you always neglected because of the lack of time‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso at the end, you‚Äôre not ‚Äòwasting‚Äô time

* You can learn a lot of new things, get a better overview of what you already know, organize your existing knowledge

* You can spend more time with your friends (although I managed to find a lot of materials online which really reduced the times when we had to talk directly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey learned from articles, books, and video tutorials, and asked questions if they had any)

* And for good karma: coding is an extremely valuable knowledge, you might help them in changing their careers, get better jobs or start working together in the future
