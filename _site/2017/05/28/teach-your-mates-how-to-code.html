    <p><em>‚ÄúHalf a year ago I was drowning in work. I had a lot on my mind, and I didn‚Äôt have any time to move forward with my personal projects - and I can tell you one thing; I‚Äôm always full of new ideas, but completing them takes a lot of time.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Meet Johnny Fekete - a digital nomad who originally comes from a business background, but taught himself how to code and is now a self-taught full-stack developer and entrepreneur. He is also the co-founder of Danish startup <a href="https://ditaso.net/en/index.php">Ditaso</a>, (a digital talent sourcing and recruitment tool.)</p>

<p>Besides developing things and teaching others, he loves long boarding and learning how to play the guitar.</p>

<h4 id="where-did-the-idea-of-teaching-your-friends-come-from"><strong>Where did the idea of teaching your friends come from</strong>?</h4>

<p>Half a year ago I had a conversation with my friend Szabi, who mentioned ‚Ääthat he would be interested in learning mobile programming.</p>

<p>At the same time, my brother had also decided that he needed a career change, he told me that he could really imagine himself as a front-end developer‚Ä¶</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúHigher education takes a lot of time, and they often teach outdated knowledge when it comes to fast-moving technologies. Besides that, my mates were both so busy with their lives, so no time for universities nor going back to school, they needed something faster and more efficient.‚Äù</em></p>

<h3 id="-1">¬†</h3>

<h4 id="talking-about-it-is-one-thing-and-starting-is-another-but-when-did-you-actually-start">Talking about it is one thing and starting is another, but when did you actually start?</h4>

<p>I don‚Äôt think there was an exact moment when I made a decision to start teaching my friends, we just started.</p>

<p>I was in a situation where I had a lot of ideas that I couldn‚Äôt bring to life because of the lack of time and I had some friends, including my brother, who were interested in learning something new - especially my brother who was really thinking about a career change.</p>

<p>The idea was that if I would spend some time on teaching them, they could actually help me with my own projects as we‚Äôd be using my projects as learning examples. It would be a great practice for them too, as they need experience, and my projects would finally move forward.</p>

<p>We talked about it many times, we figured out which areas interested them, and we found that we had similar interests in exchanging our skills.</p>

<p>A real win-win situation! üòÉ</p>

<h3 id="-2">¬†</h3>

<h4 id="can-you-tell-me-a-little-more-about-how-you-taught-them-did-your-create-your-own-learning-materials">Can you tell me a little more about how you taught them? Did your create your own learning materials?</h4>

<p>First of all I created a list for both of them about the subject/tools/techniques that I thought were relevant. Like a to-do list: if you learn this and this and that‚Ä¶you‚Äôll know enough to start developing yourself - in my opinion.</p>

<p>Then I tried to look up as many materials online, as I could. Luckily, coding are based on popular technologies that are really well covered, so very easy to find information and learning material to put together my own foundation.</p>

<p>Once we had the learning direction, my mates could move in their own pace, ask me questions when they got stuck, and I also asked questions to make sure that they understood everything.</p>

<p>I live in another country, so we had Skype sessions with screen share, where I could see what they were doing. Also, the very first thing I taught them was how to use Git, so from the first time I could review their codes.</p>

<h3 id="-3">¬†</h3>

<h4 id="what-were-some-of-the-challenges-you-encountered-during-the-process">What were some of the challenges you encountered during the process?</h4>

<p>The initial list of what to teach and where to start was tricky to write. For example, I tried to google: <em>‚ÄúWhat does a front-end developer have to know‚Äù</em>, but I didn‚Äôt really find anything in details.</p>

<p>Maybe sometimes it would have been easier to explain things in person, but thanks to screen sharing and Skype calls, there was not that much of a difference.</p>

<h4 id="so-why-teach-your-mates-how-to-code">So why teach your mates how to code?</h4>

<p>You can move forward with your own projects as you can use them as example tasks.</p>

<p>You can work on your own projects, the ones that you always neglected due to ‚Äòlack of time‚Äô.</p>

<p>You can learn a lot of new stuff on-the-go, get a better overview of what you already know and learn how to organize your existing knowledge</p>

<p>You can help people improve their skills and get better at the technologies that you know.</p>

<p>You can spend more time with your mates, so your relationships will improve.</p>

<p>And for good karma; coding is an extremely valuable knowledge, you might help your friends change their careers, get better jobs or you might even start working together in the future. A real win-win!</p>

<h3 id="-5">¬†</h3>

<h4 id="apart-from-everything-did-you-learn-or-improve-any-specific-skills-yourself">Apart from everything, did you learn or improve any specific skills yourself?</h4>

<p>Yes, I became quite a pro in react native, a technology I always wanted to master, and I learned how to explain and provide a structure for my existing knowledge.</p>
