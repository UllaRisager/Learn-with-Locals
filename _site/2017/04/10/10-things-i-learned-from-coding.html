        <h5>What I learned from coding, that wasn’t actually about coding.</h5>
      </div>
    <div>
    <p>A while back I attended a 10 day coding bootcamp in Bali with <a href="http://www.instituteofcode.com/">The Institute Of Code</a>. I’ve always had a love for beautiful web design and have started numerous websites and blogs using Wordpress, Wix and Squarespace, but when it came to actually changing and tweaking themes, I had no clue, so I decided to learn how to code, to feel empowered and to be able to realize projects on my own - projects like this.</p>

<p>Apart from learning the basics of HTML and CSS, etc. learning how to code isn’t ONLY about the technical stuff, it’s just as much about the personal development and the inner journey - at least it was for me.</p>

<p>So here are 10 things I learned from coding - that wasn’t actually about coding:</p>

<h3> </h3>

<h3 id="1-the-world-is-a-big-and-scary-place">1. The world is a big and scary place</h3>

<p>But sometimes you just have to start somewhere. I don’t think I quite got the grasp of just how big the world wide web was before I started learning more about it.</p>

<p>There are in fact numerous of icebergs of things that Man only just began to understand a few years ago, so naturally, there are some things that are hard to understand when you’re first starting out with learning.</p>

<p>Anything really - whether it is HTML, CSS or programming or a new language. The most important thing is that you just start somewhere.</p>

<h3 id="-1"> </h3>

<h3 id="2-problem-solving">2. Problem-solving</h3>

<p>I have become much better at problem-solving. I am not great, but definitely improved. When you are learning how to code, there is a lot of stuff you can’t possibly understand, because it’s like learning Russian or Hungarian (or so it seems), while I never had any problems learning a new language though, in the sense that I never found it frustrating, I found coding highly frustrating. </p>

<p>However, the feeling of being able to fix your own bug or fix broken code it just beyond fantastic. It is the most self-empowering feeling in the world when you’re first starting out and for every time you do it, you will also become better at solving other problems related to other things in life. Trust me.</p>

<h3 id="-2"> </h3>

<h3 id="3-being-a-perfectionist-has-its-good-and-bad-sides">3. Being a perfectionist has its good and bad sides</h3>

<p>Being attentive to detail is good, but you certainly don’t have to be perfect. Being a perfectionist can be a good and bad thing, in the sense that it’s ok if you would like to make things, like elements on your site a little bit prettier but don’t know how to do that, then let it be, take a break and live with it, it’s ok, nobody is gonna notice but you.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to just let it go and be ok with that nagging little error that you know is somewhere deep down inside your CSS, but nobody can see but you - I’ve definitely learned this the rather frustrating way as I am quite the perfectionist.</p>

<h3 id="-3"> </h3>

<h3 id="4-be-patient-be-patient-be-patient">4. Be patient. Be patient. Be patient! </h3>

<p>Patience is really key when learning how to code.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>Because you won’t understand everything and that’s ok, but you just have to be patient and be ok with that. I don’t know if my patience has actually improved that much, but I do know that I’ve become so much more aware of it now than ever before.</p>

<p>Especially when it comes to coding, sometimes there will be things out of your control, like poor internet connection or some line of code is acting weird and you don’t know why, if you can’t be patient and you rush to try and fix it, you might end up doing even more damage.</p>

<p>Instead, maybe that error will fix itself or you will think of a solution later on, so as with everything in life, patience is key.</p>

<h3 id="-4"> </h3>

<h3 id="5-keep-learning-and-continue-to-practice-practice-practice">5. Keep learning and continue to practice, practice, practice </h3>

<p>It really is amazing what you can do if you keep learning and practicing.</p>

<p>Think about kids when learning how to code, because kids never give up, they just keep going and going until they’ve mastered what they’ve set out to do - and so should you!</p>

<p>So keep this in mind when learning.</p>

<h3 id="-5"> </h3>

<h3 id="6-you-dont-have-to-remember-everything">6. You don’t have to remember everything</h3>

<p>Remember you can google anything. Pretty much. But one thing is to google something and another is to understand how to google and what your answers are. I’ve definitely also learned how to be a better googler, it sounds strange, but it’s so true. </p>

<p>So remember when you are learning how to code, you don’t have to remember everything, but if you learn how to google stuff, you will be doing yourself a big favor.</p>

<h3 id="-6"> </h3>

<h3 id="7-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-for-help">7. Don’t be afraid to ask for help</h3>

<p>When you’re learning, you are most likely going to be needing some help at some point, so instead of trying to do, learn and understand everything yourself, it’s ok to ask for help.</p>

<p>People are generally super helpful when it comes to answering questions and sharing learning experiences online and in real-life. Take advantage of that.</p>

<h3 id="-7"> </h3>

<h3 id="8-remember-your-brain-is-like-a-hard-drive">8. Remember your brain is like a hard drive</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is full too, so you’ll need to clean it up and free up some space, this is very very important when learning.</p>

<p>Give yourself some space and don’t take things to seriously, have fun, exercise and take breaks, recharge and do something completely different. Often you’ll see that when you return to your task, the problem that you were trying to solve has solved itself.</p>

<h3 id="-8"> </h3>

<h3 id="9-one-step-at-the-time">9. One step at the time</h3>

<p>Rome wasn’t built in a day. I think that’s enough said.</p>

<h3 id="-9"> </h3>

<h3 id="10-always-persevere">10. Always persevere </h3>

<p>Never giving up, never give up on practicing, playing around, discovering new tools and tricks and reading up on new developments and most importantly, being curious.</p>

<p>(I am writing this one for me too!)</p>
