#### How being turned down by Airbnb made me start my own business.

Exactly two years ago in 2015, I sat in my parent’s living room in the remote countryside in Denmark, writing on my final BA thesis on how to innovate Airbnb’s business model and I came up with one idea; to offers Airbnb guests’ and travelers a new way of experiencing a destination through real-life experiences.

I called this concept ‘Meet a Local’

It would give Airbnb hosts and Locals a chance to earn more and create new sources of income while helping people experience destinations in new and meaningful ways.

Airbnb’s new segment; ‘The Local’ would be a person who could offer unique cultural experiences from design, photography and street art, to ethnic food tours, private dinners, beer tastings and underground history, sightseeing and immersive cultural exchange.

#### 'A Local'
‘A Local’ could be anyone, your mom or dad, your aunt or cousin, it could be baby-boomers who were retired, but still active, Millennials who were creating a career for themselves or a GenX’er who had grown tired of the corporate suit-and-tie-world and was looking for other ways to make a living.

A lot of options here, agree?

Well turns out, I took this idea and went and met Chip Conley, who was the Head of Global Hospitality and Strategy at Airbnb at the time and I said to him, I have an idea, I would like to work for Airbnb - he said, let me get my glasses. So I pitched my idea and he said: “That’s exactly what we’re doing - send me an email.” So I did.

I never got a job, but I ended up going to Paris and LA for their Airbnb Open Festivals, I met a bunch of creative and inspiring people, and I survived a Terrorist Attack - yes believe it or not.

#### So where does Learn With Locals and starting this business fit in at all?

Well it turns out that I tried to get a job with Airbnb for the next two years and I am not lying when I tell you that I have sent over 10 job applications through for different roles all over the world from SF, Copenhagen, to Shanghai and London. I made it to the last round for one role and was declined only to find out that the role had been shut down, I’ve talked to a dozen of recruiters, taken online tests and made self-promotional videos. I’ve even sent direct emails to Brian Chesky - CEO of Airbnb twice! And I think I also even stalked his gf at some point on instagram, (now I’m just stalking her because i think she’s way cooler than him) anyways, my point is, I ended up giving up. I told myself I wouldn’t give up, but I did, so here I am.

I’m not embarrassed to mention this, because maybe “giving up” was exactly what led me here - to creating Learn With Locals.

I think what finally led me to stop chasing down a job with Airbnb was when I was traveling in Mexico and the perfect job came up, market manager for their new Trips Experiences, no 10 year experience needed, just an entrepreneurial outlook and willingness to travel, sounded like the perfect role for me, so I applied, but I didn’t create a standard Cover Letter - no way, I created a web site and hooked it up with google analytics to track visits. I then sent it off and 2 days later, i got a reply back that I was not suitable for the role, I then went and looked at the analytics, only to find that no one had visited my page, so I tracked down the Head recruiter in Dublin, Ireland and sent er an in mail through Linkedin, it worked, two days later the role had been taken down, deleted everywhere, I had just spent so much time making my application and it was taken down. I was pretty upset and angry to be honest.

Then when that same role, in a different wording came back up a few weeks later, I sent off that same application and this time I got a reply back 3 weeks later that I wasn’t a suitable candidate and I didn’t even bother to look at google analytics because I knew that no-one had even looked at my page. So much for trying to be creative and a little bit different and innovative with one of the worlds most disruptive startups. I guess the startup creativity hasn’t permeated into their HR department or it was never there. To be honest all of the recruiters I ever talked to sounded like they’d rather be somewhere else.

So I closed that chapter and started thinking about my concept of ‘Meet A Local’. I went to Bali to learn how to code, and when the day came to make up wireframes for our portfolio websites, I said to my mentor, I’m gonna do a blog and he said, no you’re gonna do this business idea, we can create a fully working MVP, so I did it - of course with the help of everyone at IOC, but the idea was mine and I tweaked it to fit my own needs, because to be honest, I’ve never booked any of Airbnb’s Trip Experiences because they were either too expensive or too “average” despite being super curated and cool, I would rather upskill and learn, so I put everything into that and that’s where LEARN WITH LOCALS started.

The outcome clearly proves a paradigm shift from brand- centric to customer-centric as people have become self- empowered through the use of digital technology and innovation. I think it is extremely interesting to try and understand this shift.

#### It all revolves around people, connections and relationships.

Everything that we are surrounded by only makes sense in a world where we feel like we belong - a place is not simply a location anymore, but it is about the people who make up the surroundings of a given place, creating a visceral place inside of us.

Ultimately, it all comes down to seeing something in others, that touches something in us - I believe that this is what drives a change in behaviour and mindset among a given group of people - early adopters and innovators and their behaviour will eventually manifest into more and more people’s minds and feelings, creating a new paradigm.

Traveling is no longer only about the trip and the destination - but it is about how we experience the trip viscerally and how it changes our worldview - so this is what I am trying to touch upon by starting Learn With Locals.
