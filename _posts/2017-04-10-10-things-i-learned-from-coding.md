10 things I learned from coding - that isn’t actually about coding...

A while back I attended a 10 day coding bootcamp in Bali with The Institute Of Code. I’ve always had a love for beautiful web design and have started numerous websites and blogs using wordpress, wix and squarespace, but when it came to actually changing and tweaking themes, I had no clue, so I decided to learn how to code, to feel empowered and to be able to realise projects on my own - projects like this.

Apart from learning the basics of HTML and CSS, etc, there is a number of things that I have also learned about myself as a person that I would like to share with you here because learning how to code isn’t ONLY about the technical part, it’s just as much about the personal development and the inner journey - at least it was for me.

So here are 10 things I learned from coding - that isn’t actually about coding:

The world is a big and scary place and sometimes you just have to start somewhere. I don’t think I quite got the grasp of just how big the world wide web is and that there are numerous icebergs of things that Man only just began to understand a few years ago. So naturally, there are some things that are hard to understand for you too, when you’re first starting out with learning - anything really - whether it is HTML, CSS or programming or a new language. The most important thing is that you just start somewhere.

Problem-solving. I have become much better at problem-solving. I am not great, but definitely improved. When you are learning how to code, there is a lot of stuff you can’t possibly understand, because it’s a different language, while I never had any problems learning a new language, in the sense that I never found it frustrating, I found coding highly frustrating, but the feeling of being able to fix your own bug or fix broken code it just beyond fantastic. It is the most self-empowering feeling in the world when you’re first starting out and for every time you do it, you will also become better at solving other problems related to other things in life. Trust me.

Being a perfectionist has its good and bad sides. Being attentive to detail is goodYo certainly don’t have to be perfect. , but you don’t have to be a perfectionist, in the sense that it’s ok if you would like to make things a little&nbsp; bit prettier but don’t know how to do that, then let it be, take a break and live with it - it’s ok, nobody is gonna notice but you. Sometimes you have to just let it go and be ok with that nagging little error that you know is somewhere deep downside your CSS, but nobody can see but you - I’ve definitely learned this the hard way.

Be patient. Be patient. Be patient&nbsp; Patience is really key when learning how to code. Why? Because you won’t understand everything and that’s ok, but you just have to be patient and be ok with that. I don’t know if my patience has actually improved, but I am so much more aware of it now than ever before. Especially now I know that when it comes to coding, sometimes there will be things out of your control, like poor internet connection or something is acting weird and you don’t know why, if you can stay patient, maybe that error will fix itself or you will think of a solution later on, so with everything in life, patience is key to learning.

Keep learning and it’s amazing what you can do. It really is amazing what you can do with the internet these days and if you keep learning, you will be able to build a lot of stuff, it’s one thing that you will be aware of, not saying that I am doing it, but I am aware of how that all works now.

You don’t have to remember everything. You can google anything. I’ve also learned to be a better google. Yes, before I wasn’t so sure how I could google things, but now I’ve learned that you can google almost anything

don’t be afraid to ask for help, people are generally super helpful when it comes to answering questions and sharing learning experiences. Take advantage of that.

Remember your brain is a hard drive, sometimes it’s full too, so you need to clean it up and create some space, this is very important&nbsp;

Remember to have fun, exercise and don’t take things to seriously

One step at the time and continuous practice will help you a long way.
