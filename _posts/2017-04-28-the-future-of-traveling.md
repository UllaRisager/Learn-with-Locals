When we think of traveling most people think or packing a bag and going somewhere physically and geographically - moving.

But traveling can also be an inner journey - an inner transformation and this type of trip is all about "being moved" and how we experience the journey viscerally.

[Alain de Botton](http://alaindebotton.com/), renowned Author, Philosopher and founder of ‘The School of Life’ said that:

> *“A journey is a process of feeling and inner transformation  and travel is a psychological experience and the psychological ingredient of happiness is why we travel.”*

> “Travel, culture and art exist in the people we meet, so we need to be the creator of the ingredient and make life into a life of art!”

### So what does the future of travel actually look like?

Traveling is not simply a destination anymore, but it revolves around the people who make up the atmosphere of a given place, which is creating a visceral place inside of us.

So if traveling is a journey of inner transformation, it probably has ambition to change something in our inner world and the only way for this to happen is if we challenge ourselves and learn.

Ultimately, I think this is the future of traveling, because this is what drives a change in behaviour and mindset among a given group of people.

Early adopters and innovators will see this and their behaviour will eventually manifest into more and more people’s minds and feelings, creating a new paradigm and thus a shift in travel behaviour.

Not just a shift promoting learning, experiential traveling and personal empowerment, but it all comes down to feeling like we belong somewhere and connection - about seeing something in others, that touches something in us.

### How so?

There's a big difference between traveling and going on a holiday for most people, but does it really have to be this way? Who says we can't take time off from our "real lives" to go explore a destination and still challenge ourselves and learn and grow?

I personally believe that when we’re traveling, we’re of course moving, but we also want to be moved! Experiences that “move” us are usually those we tell our friends and family about when we come back, because those are the ones that stick.

### So why travel and learn?

Because death and taxes are the only sure and inevitable things in this world and I’m just trying to make sure I’m prepared to let go when that time comes. I do not want to wake up one day thinking, “what if” and feeling regret for the things I never did, the words I never said, the feelings I never felt and the dreams I never lived.

To me, traveling truly is a journey of inner transformation, but it doesn't have to start with going somewhere, it can start with learning something new, like coding, with challenging yourself this, to me, is the only true way of traveling.
