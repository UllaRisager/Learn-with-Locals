A Journey Of Inner Transformation&nbsp;

Alain de Botton, renowned Author, Philosopher and founder of ‘The School of Life’ said that:

&nbsp;“A journey is a process of feeling and inner transformation . Travel is a psychological experience and the psychological ingredient of happiness is why we travel – and travel, culture and art exist in the people we meet, so we need to be the creator of the ingredient and make life into a life of art!”

This pretty much sums it up - when you’re traveling you’re moving, but you also want to be moved!&nbsp;

“Traveling has ambition to change something in the inner world”  but the only way for this to happen is if we challenge ourselves and learn while traveling. There's a big difference between traveling and going on a holiday for most people, but does't it really have to be this way? Who says we can't take time off from our "real lives" to go explore a destination and still challenge ourselves and learn and grow?

Well now you can.

I know exactly why I’m traveling and it essentially all comes down to three things:

Connection

Growth

Meaning

I do not want to wake up one day thinking, “what if” and feeling strong emotions of regret for the things I never did, the words I never said, the feelings I never felt and the dreams I never lived.

Death is the only sure and inevitable thing in this world and I’m just trying to make sure I’m prepared to let go when that time comes.

Traveling is a journey &nbsp;but it doesnt' have to start with going somwhere, it can start within and…with a simple thought - to challenge yourself - that is the future of traveling.
