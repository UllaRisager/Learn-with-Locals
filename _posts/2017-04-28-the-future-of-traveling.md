A Journey Of Inner Transformation

Traveling is no longer only about the trip or the destination - but it's about how we experience the trip viscerally and how it changes our current worldview.

[Alain de Botton](http://alaindebotton.com/), renowned Author, Philosopher and founder of ‘The School of Life’ said that:

> “A journey is a process of feeling and inner transformation  and travel is a psychological experience and the psychological ingredient of happiness is why we travel.”

> “Travel, culture and art exist in the people we meet, so we need to be the creator of the ingredient and make life into a life of art!”

So what Botton is really saying is that traveling is a journey of inner transformation that has ambition to change something in our inner world, but the only way for this to happen is if we challenge ourselves and learn.

### So what does the future of travel actually look like?

Traveling is not simply a destination anymore, but it revolves around the people who make up the atmosphere of a given place, which is creating a visceral place inside of us.

Ultimately, I think that the way traveling is changing in the future is not only through learning, experiential traveling and personal empowerment, but it all comes down to feeling like we belong somewhere and connection - about seeing something in others, that touches something in us.

This is what drives a change in behaviour and mindset among a given group of people - early adopters and innovators whose behaviour will eventually manifest into more and more people’s minds and feelings, creating a new paradigm and thus a shift in travel behaviour.

Death is the only sure and inevitable thing in this world and I’m just trying to make sure I’m prepared to let go when that time comes. I do not want to wake up one day thinking, “what if” and feeling strong emotions of regret for the things I never did, the words I never said, the feelings I never felt and the dreams I never lived.

### How so?

There's a big difference between traveling and going on a holiday for most people, but does it really have to be this way? Who says we can't take time off from our "real lives" to go explore a destination and still challenge ourselves and learn and grow?

I personally believe that when we’re traveling, we’re of course moving, but we also want to be moved! Experiences that “move” us are usually those we telll our friends and family about when we come back, because those are the ones that stick.

To me, traveling is a journey of inner transformation, but it doesn't have to start with going somewhere, it can start within and with a simple thought - to challenge yourself - that is the future of traveling.
