I love writing, but there’s a very big difference between journaling and writing content for others to read.

It wasn’t until I met Ali - a digital nomad, holistic health coach and journalist living in Ubud, Bali, that I realized just how bad my writing actually was.

Turns our Ali had studied journalism, only she wasn’t really working within this field, instead she was a holistic health coach turned digital nomad - who just happened to be at the same co-workation with [The Institute Of Code](http://www.instituteofcode.com/) that I was also attending.

She gave me a few tricks on writing and how to structure my content - that I would like to share with you here.

### 1. Headline

The first thing to do once you know more or less what your topic is, is to find your first liner, your headline.

One way you can do this is to just empty your mind and let your thoughts lose. E.g. if your topic is journaling and how it has helped you, ask yourself what journaling has done for you?

E.g Journaling has helped me heal, so the next question is; what was the most important way journaling helped you heal?

From the first and most important thing that comes to your mind, you can usually extract your headline.

### 2. Opening

Secondly you'll want to open your story with an Opening, so in this case, ask yourself, what triggered you to start journaling?

This shouldn’t be more than a few lines long. (No more than 7-10 sentences).

### 3. Body

Next up is your body, so just like coding, we also have a body when structuring our writing.

In this case I would add 3 points as my body, so point 1-3 would be something like this:

* It helped me organize my thoughts (5-8 sentences).
* It helped me reflect on my progress (5-8 sentences).
* It helped me feel less lonely (5-8 sentences).

### 4. Closing

Last but not least, you’ll want to add a Closing, this is very important as it helps call to action and sum up the entire point of the story.

Keep it short and to the point and always remember to include a call to action, especially if you are writing a blog and trying to grow your audience.

### 5. Why learn with a local?

**1. Personal recommendations** is something you don't get from watching tutorial or reading how-to-blogs online, this will not even give you personal recommendations.

If you want the personal touch, you really have to get up and go meet someone in person, because it is just done so much better in real-life and not behind a screen.

Because Ali actually sat down and read through some of my writing, she was able to give me a personal recommendation based on my content and struggles.

It was so awesome because she divided my content into sections and explained me about the above mentioned basic structure and how I could emphasize the most important parts.&nbsp;

**2. Creating relevant and unique content,**people's attention spans are very short, so when you write unfiltered and without limits, all you are doing is probably making people leave your site.

Ali also taught me how not to write a novel but keep it short, (although I still fail to do so, but I will keep practicing.)

**3. All the stuff in between - exactly!**All the stuff that Ali taught me was just so invaluable and what's even better is that when I then went to visit her in Ubud, she shared with me all her little secret spots around Ubud and it was just so amazing to meet her and learn more about what she does. It truly left me inspired to do something on my own.

### So why am I sharing this?

I think learning from someone like Ali, just makes all the difference than opposed to learning on your own at home.

At home you're probably stressed out and not really open to learning and meeting people in the same way as you are when you're traveling and on holiday.

If you’re interested in writing and becoming a better writer or content creator, I strongly recommend learning from someone like Ali, it doesn’t have to be in Bali and it doesn’t have to be her, but what better way to learn than from a passionate person who inspires you?
