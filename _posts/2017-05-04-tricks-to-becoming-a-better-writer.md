I love writing, but there’s a very big difference between journaling and writing content for others to read.

It wasn’t until I met Ali - a digital nomad living in Ubud, Bali, that I realized just how bad my writing actually was.

Turns our Ali had studied journalism, only she wasn’t really working within this field, instead she was a holistic health coach turned digital nomad - who just happened to be at the same co-workation with Institute Of Code that I was also attending.

She gave me a few tricks on writing and how to structure my content - that I would like to share with you here, because I just found this so useful, when I was feeling pretty lost:

  1. The first thing to do once you know more or less what your topic is, is to find your first liner, your headline. One way you can do this is to just empty your mind and let your thoughts go crazy. E.g. if your topic is journaling and how it has helped your heal, ask yourself what was the most important way journaling helped you heal? And the first and most important thing that comes to your mind, is usually you headline.

  2. Secondly you wanna open your story with an Opening, so in this case, ask yourself, what triggered you to start journaling? This shouldn’t be more than a few lines long. (No more than 7-10 sentences).

  3. Next up is your body, so just like coding, we also have a body when structuring our writing.

  4. In this case I am going to add 3 points as my body, so point 1 could be something like this:

    1. It helped me organize my thoughts (5-8 sentences)
    2. It helped me reflect on my progress (5-8) sentences
    3. It helped me feel less lonely (5-8 sentences)

    5. Last but not least, you’ll want to add a Closing, this is very important as it helps call to action and sum up the entire point o f the story. Keep it short and to the point and always remember to include a call to action, especially if you are writing a blog and trying to grow your audience.

So why did I shared this with you today? Well because maybe you’re an aspiring writer or experienced writer, who knows, no matter what, there’s always room for improvement and I’m not lying when I say that I think learning from someone like Ali, just makes all the difference.

Why?

Because Ali, actually sat down and read some of my writing and what I was struggling with, she then divided my content into actions and explained me about structure and how I could emphasize the most important parts, something I had no clue how to do before meeting Ali.

If you’re interested in writing and becoming a better writer or content creator, I strongly recommend learning from someone like Ali, it doesn’t have to be in Bali and it doesn’t have to be her, but what better way to learn that from Locals?
